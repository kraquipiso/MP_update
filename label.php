    Peter Mekwunye, having recently moved to the United States from Nigeria, self-released One Kind Of Love as a small run cassette in 1993 under the moniker Pedro. His only prior recording experience being a brief session in a friend’s professional recording studio, Peter was determined to continue making music once finding a home in Portland, OR. He assembled a basic home studio (limited to a Casio keyboard, a microphone, and a multitrack recorder) and set to work recording One Kind Of Love; a unique and personal album, filled with free-form and pop elements in equal measure, and always Pedro’s voice with it’s message of love, struggle, spirituality, and hope. Finding inspiration in traditional Nigerian music, as well as the popular sounds he grew up hearing on the radio (including Fela Kuti and William Onyeabor), and as left field as artists like Chuck Mangione and Beethoven (because he continued to create music even beyond his ability to sense it). Peter consigned copies of One Kind Of Love at record shops all over the city, but it remained mostly unheard in 1993, and certainly under appreciated. Stumbling upon this cassette and reaching out to Peter resulted in his being reunited with this music for the first time in years, and together it is our pleasure to share it with you, now lovingly remastered by Brandon Hocura of Invisible City, and available for the first time ever in the LP format. This is revolutionary music, and it couldn’t have resurfaced at a more necessary time. As the inscription reads, “This album is dedicated to all Nigerians all over the world, and to all freedom fighters around the world.”

    <h3>Visible Cloaks - s/t LP (MP001)</h3>
    <img src="img/visiblecloakscover.png"/>
    <p>
    The music of Visible Cloaks — the duo of Spencer D and Ryan Carlile, previously known as just “Cloaks” — has been bubbling under the surface of the already rich situation of experimental electronic song-smiths that exists in Portland, OR., and with only a handful of limited CDRs, a few tape releases (the most recent of which came out last year on Cameron “Sun Araw” Stallones’ Sun Ark Editions) and a string of albums released exclusively in Japan, we’ve had to rely on catching them live to find out where they’d been exploring, and what new environments they’d recreate for us. Visible Cloaks “live in a weird zone where corporate Japanese ambient music meets fourth world pop abstraction” (Michael Klausman, Other Music). The collision of synthesized and acoustic sounds, and genres usually associated with either — from Eno or Steve Roach’s ambience to Javanese Gamelan —, are intertwined so effortlessly and effectively that trying to parse out distinct sources is of foolhardy focus. Just as Haruomi Hosono created the magical space between India and Japan with Cochin Moon, Visible Cloaks are building unique worlds and it’s our pleasure to be able to visit them. Their debut LP includes the studio recorded pieces from the Sun Ark tape as well as previously unreleased material. Edition of 300.
